## Introduction
This is the third model of my WPF Dashboard series. We have a main window with 
side bar that permits navigation between different screens. This mainly focuses on
responsiveness of the app.

## Getting started
### Try The Published (production) app
Download the latest zip package from the repo. Unzip the file in your windows 
machine and double click on **WPFDashboard3.exe** file. You are good to go.

### Developer
You want to play with the code ? Clone, download or fork the repo.
Restore the packages
```console
dotnet restore
```

Or, if you have Visual Studio or C# dev kit in VSCode, this should run automatically
when you open the app.

You are good to go. Enjoy.
